## 1. Objective

To analyze the impact of the Gemini CLI v0.28.2 update on the `bkit-gemini` extension, identify any compatibility issues or deprecated features, and propose necessary updates to ensure full stability and feature utilization.

## 2. Team Composition (CTO Team)

| Role | Agent | Responsibility |
|------|-------|----------------|
| **Project Lead** | `cto-lead` | Overall strategy, decision making, and report approval. |
| **QA Strategist** | `qa-strategist` | Test strategy for new CLI features, regression testing plan. |
| **Architecture** | `enterprise-expert` | Impact on microservices/hooks architecture, scalability checks. |
| **Code Analysis** | `code-analyzer` | Static analysis of codebase against new CLI patterns (e.g., hooks). |

## 3. Scope of Analysis

### 3.1 Key Gemini CLI v0.28.2 Features to Analyze

1.  **Strict Hook Warnings & Permissions**:
    *   *Impact Area*: `hooks/hooks.json`, `hooks/scripts/`
    *   *Risk*: Custom hooks might be blocked or require user confirmation, affecting UX.
2.  **Skill Activation Optimization**:
    *   *Impact Area*: `lib/skill-orchestrator.js`, `activate_skill` tool usage.
    *   *Risk*: Changes in how skills are loaded might require updates to the orchestrator logic.
3.  **Tool Sandbox & Isolation**:
    *   *Impact Area*: `gemini-extension.json` (`excludeTools`), file system operations in agents.
    *   *Risk*: Tools might be restricted from accessing certain paths or executing shell commands.
4.  **Dynamic Terminal Titles**:
    *   *Impact Area*: UX, potential conflict if `bkit` tries to set titles (unlikely, but check).
    *   *Risk*: Low.
5.  **Large Text Handling**:
    *   *Impact Area*: `read_file`, `write_file` for large templates.
    *   *Risk*: Low, potentially beneficial.
6.  **`/agents refresh` Command**:
    *   *Impact Area*: Developer workflow, `bkit` update instructions.
    *   *Risk*: Documentation update needed.

### 3.2 Affected bkit Components

*   `gemini-extension.json`: Manifest configuration.
*   `hooks/`: All hook scripts.
*   `lib/`: Core logic, especially `skill-orchestrator.js`.
*   `docs/`: Installation/Update guides.

## 4. Execution Strategy

1.  **Plan (Current)**: Define scope and team.
2.  **Design**: Create a detailed checklist and test cases for each v0.28.2 feature.
3.  **Analyze (Do/Check)**:
    *   Review `hooks.json` for permission compatibility.
    *   Review `lib/skill-orchestrator.js` against new skill activation patterns.
    *   Review `gemini-extension.json` for tool configuration.
4.  **Report (Act)**: Summarize findings and recommend specific code changes or documentation updates.

## 5. Success Criteria

*   All 4 key v0.28.2 features are analyzed for impact.
*   A clear "Action Required" list is generated.
*   A final report is produced with a Go/No-Go recommendation for specific updates.
