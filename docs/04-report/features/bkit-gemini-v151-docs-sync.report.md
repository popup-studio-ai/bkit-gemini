## 2. PDCA Cycle Summary

### Plan Phase
- **Document**: `docs/01-plan/features/bkit-gemini-v151-docs-sync.plan.md`
- **Research**: 9 official sources (Gemini CLI docs, blog, release notes, GitHub)
- **Output**: 8 Functional Requirements, file inventory, feature counts verified against 258-test report

### Design Phase
- **Document**: `docs/02-design/features/bkit-gemini-v151-docs-sync.design.md`
- **Output**: Per-file content specifications, consistency matrix, implementation order

### Do Phase
- **Files Modified**: 6 existing + 1 new (CHANGELOG.md)
- **Strategy**: Parallel creation of smaller files (CHANGELOG, extension JSON, NOTICE, bkit.toml), then GEMINI.md, then README.md (largest)

### Check Phase
- **Method**: gap-detector agent with 135 verification points
- **Result**: 100% Match Rate (135/135 PASS)
- **Source Code Cross-Reference**: All counts verified against actual files on disk

### Act Phase
- Propagated Gemini CLI v0.28.0+ badge change across README.md and NOTICE
- No other corrective actions needed
