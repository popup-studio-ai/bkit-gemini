Action: {{args}}

Guide the user through bkend.ai file storage:
1. Single file upload (3-step: presigned URL, PUT binary, register metadata)
2. Multiple file upload with batch presigned URLs
3. Multipart upload for large files
4. File download (CDN for public, presigned URL for private)
5. 4 visibility levels (public, private, protected, shared)

Use REST API directly - there are no MCP tools for storage.
Delegate backend tasks to bkend-expert agent.
